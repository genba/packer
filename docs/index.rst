A new type of package manager

*Still under development*


Goals
-----

Package management works but it is far from ideal. There is no simple,
free, platform agnostic way to distribute software. Let's fix this.

Enter **Packer**, a package manager built from scratch to support simple
multiplatform software installation

It should be:

* Simple
* Extendable
* Multiplatform (Starting with Windows, OSX, Ubuntu)


Installation
------------

Install using the following command::

    pip install packer


Dependencies:

* Python 2.7 (must be on PATH)
* pip
* pywin32 (Windows)


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
